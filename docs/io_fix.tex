\section*{Debugging Methodology and Findings}
The debugging process adopted a systematic approach, starting with potential extrinsic factors. The influence of a somatic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) noise process, described in the reference model but initially omitted, was investigated. Integrating this process revealed high sensitivity; varying noise parameters produced counter-intuitive results where lower noise levels paradoxically increased network-wide spiking, suggesting noise played a complex role in modulating network synchrony rather than simply driving individual neurons across threshold. Setting both the baseline and variance of the OU process to zero eventually eliminated spiking, indicating the IO network\'s excitability was highly sensitive to net input, but did not fully explain the initial discrepancy.

Attention then shifted to intrinsic parameters and coupling. A critical finding emerged regarding the initialization of the low-threshold calcium conductance ($g_{CaL}$), where subtle differences in random number generation sequences between the isolated and network simulations led to distinct parameter instantiations, highlighting the model\'s sensitivity. Standardizing this initialization was a necessary step.

Further investigation focused on the intercellular coupling via gap junctions, a key feature of IO networks. The implementation of the gap junction current was compared against the reference model\'s equations, specifically the voltage-dependent modulation function $f(V)$ and the base conductance $g_c$. Significant differences were found in both aspects. The voltage-dependent function implemented initially did not match the documented equation ($f(V) = 0.6 e^{-V^2 / 2500} + 0.4$). Moreover, the base conductance used in the simulation ($g_{gj} = 0.05$) differed substantially from the value stated in the text ($g_c = 0.00125$ mS/cm$^2$).

Correcting the mathematical formula for the voltage-dependent modulation $f(V)$ was performed first. Subsequently, adjusting the base conductance revealed that maintaining the empirically used value of $g_{gj} = 0.05$ mS/cm$^2$, rather than the text\'s stated $g_c = 0.00125$ mS/cm$^2$, in conjunction with the corrected $f(V)$ formula, successfully reproduced the desired IO dynamics within the full network â€“ stable sub-threshold oscillations punctuated by occasional, physiologically plausible spikes (when appropriate noise or synaptic input was present). This suggests either a potential inconsistency in the reference paper\'s parameter reporting or the necessity for empirical tuning within the specific simulation framework. The logic of the inhibitory synaptic input from DCN to IO was also reviewed and corrected to ensure proper decay and application of inhibitory currents.

\section*{Conclusion and Key Learnings}
The resolution of the anomalous IO spiking highlights several important aspects of computational neuroscience modeling. Firstly, the collective dynamics of coupled non-linear systems, like the IO network with gap junctions, can be exquisitely sensitive to both intrinsic parameters (e.g., $g_{CaL}$) and coupling strength ($g_{gj}$). Secondly, extrinsic noise can have complex, non-monotonic effects on network synchrony and excitability. Thirdly, meticulous verification of implemented mathematical formulations (e.g., gap junction voltage dependence) against source descriptions is paramount. Finally, discrepancies between documented parameters and those required for stable simulation may arise, necessitating careful empirical validation and potential parameter tuning within the specific computational context. This debugging exercise underscored the iterative nature of model development, requiring systematic isolation, testing, and refinement of model components and their interactions to achieve biologically plausible network behavior.
